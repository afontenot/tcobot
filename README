A small caching server and associated user script to remotely fetch Twitter's t.co shortlinks to avoid user tracking. Run it on your own server or use the test server below.

The userscript by default replaces "https://t.co/[linkcode]" with "https://tco.bot.nu/[linkcode]". This is a test server running this script. This server keeps no logs except with nginx. IP addresses are scrubbed from the logs every 24 hours. While the server is intended to run 24/7, its uptime and correct behavior cannot be guaranteed. NO WARRANTY is provided for either the code or the service.

Note that the userscripts seem to be a bit buggy at present due to problems in the various userscript managers caused by Firefox's transition to webextensions in version 57.
